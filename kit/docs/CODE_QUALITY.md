# Code Quality — anti-slop conventions

A short, enforceable list of the patterns an AI assistant (or a tired human) tends to emit
that look fine and quietly rot a codebase. The rule is not "review for these later" — it is
**do not write them in the first place**, and **flag them on sight** in review.

Adapt the concrete syntax to your language; the intent is universal.

## The seven slop patterns

1. **Trivial comments.** A comment that restates the adjacent line adds noise and goes stale.
   ```
   // increment i
   i++
   ```
   Comment *why*, not *what* — and only when the code cannot express it (a non-obvious
   business rule, a handled edge case, a workaround, an invariant). If the line is obvious,
   delete the comment.

2. **Empty or broad swallowing catches.** A catch that hides the error is a bug with a delay.
   ```
   try { risky() } catch (e) { /* ignore */ }
   ```
   Every catch must do one of: recover, return a documented safe default, or log a
   plain-language degradation at the right level. Catch the narrowest type you can. If you
   truly intend to ignore, say *why* in one comment — the reason, not the fact.

3. **Hardcoded values where a token exists.** A literal color, dimension, URL, or magic
   number inlined where the project has a theme attribute / constant / config entry. It
   breaks theming, environments, and reuse. Reference the token; if none exists and the value
   recurs, create one.

4. **Lifecycle-unsafe async / global mutable scope.** Launching work that outlives or
   races its owner — a coroutine/promise tied to nothing, a subscription never cancelled, a
   module-level mutable singleton where a scoped instance belongs. Use the project's scoped
   concurrency and lifecycle-aware collection. Never reach for a global scope because it is
   shorter.

5. **Non-facade logging.** `print`, `console.log`, `System.out`, `println` in shipped code.
   Route through the project's logging facade (`<LOGGER>`) so level, format, and sink are
   controlled. Diagnostics you would be embarrassed to ship do not get committed.

6. **Shipped stubs.** `TODO()`, `throw NotImplementedError`, `fatalError("unimplemented")`,
   `raise NotImplementedError` on a path that actually runs. A stub on a live path is a crash
   waiting for a user. Either implement it or gate it so it cannot be reached, and track the
   gap in a ticket.

7. **Dead weight left behind.** A change that supersedes code/resources/config but leaves the
   old version, an orphaned key, or a build keep-rule naming a deleted symbol. Delete the
   remnant in the *same* change. Before deleting a zero-reference artifact, check it is not
   active scaffolding for an in-flight ticket. Verify "removed from the build" on the real
   target/release artifact, not a debug build.

## Structural rules

- **Dependency direction.** Respect `<ARCH_LAYERS>`. An outer layer may depend on an inner
  one, never the reverse. No cross-layer shortcuts "just this once".
- **Thin entry points.** Controllers / activities / route handlers wire and delegate; they do
  not hold business logic. Logic lives in named helper/service classes.
- **File-size budget.** Past ~`<MAX_LOC>` lines, extract a cohesive helper. Size is a proxy
  for "this file does too many things".
- **Naming.** Match the codebase's existing convention exactly. Consistency beats your
  personal preference.
- **Scope of a change.** Fix the thing asked. No opportunistic refactor, no unrelated import
  cleanup, no drive-by reformatting — those drown the real diff and break `git blame`.

## Comment discipline (the one worth repeating)

A good comment explains a decision the code cannot: *why this order*, *why this guard*, *why
not the obvious approach*. A bad comment narrates the code, repeats the function name, or
describes what a reader can see. When you edit a region, read its existing comments first and
treat them as intent — do not silently invalidate them. Remove comments that have gone stale.

## Why this is a document, not a vibe

Each pattern above is greppable. A reviewer — human or agent — can scan a diff for empty
catches, inline hex, raw `print`, `TODO()`, and orphaned keys mechanically. Make the check
part of "done", not part of "someday". If your stack has a linter, encode as many of these as
rules so the gate is automatic and the assistant gets fast feedback.
